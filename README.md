# ðŸ“¡ TheMailConditioner: The Network Knows Everything
### **Designed to Map Everything, Even the Unknown**

ðŸš€ **What is TheMailConditioner?**  
It's a way to **map numbers to numbers**, much like how IP addresses map to MAC addresses.  
IPv4? **4 bytes.**  
IPv6? **16 bytes.**  
But what about **something even bigger?**  
Well, this system allows **any entry with any entry.** **No limits.**

ðŸ’¡ **ExpiryWorkBase + TheMailConditioner = Intelligent Data Mapping**  
- **Everything has a location.**  
- **If it's not found within 10 minutes, it's gone.**  
- **Private IPs? You're safe.**  
- **Public IPs? You know what you're exposing.**
